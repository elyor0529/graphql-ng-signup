This is the repo of my tutorial series posted on [Dev.to](https://dev.to),

## So, what is this tutorial about?

We've a GraphQL server built on [apollo-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server). This server has just one [type](https://github.com/gugadev/graphql-ng-signup/tree/master/back/src/users/user.type.ts), [one query and one mutation](https://github.com/gugadev/graphql-ng-signup/tree/master/back/src/users/user.resolver.ts). The query is to fetch an user and the mutation to create one.

The client is an Angular (7) app. This app will consume the GraphQL API using [apollo-angular](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-angular).

## What will we learn?

Hope you're excited too! We'll learn a bunch of amazing things. Check it out:

- GraphQL
- Apollo
- Type GraphQL (for schema definition)
- Custom GraphQL errors
- Pino (for logging)
- Angular
- Integration of Apollo with Angular
- Reactive forms
